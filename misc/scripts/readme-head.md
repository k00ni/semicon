## Sponsor an icon

You can sponsor an icon. Feel free to contact me, if you are interested (contact details [here](https://github.com/k00ni)). This would not only provide further icons for the community but also helps covering my expenses maintaining the icons.

## Commercial support

I provide paid support for semicon. For instance. if you want new icons, which should not be publicly available. Contact details [here](https://github.com/k00ni).
